[00:18.20] Woo, woo
[00:19.55] I pull up like
[00:21.75] How you pull up, Baby? How you pull up? (Oh, oh, oh)
[00:22.96] How you pull up? I pull up (woo, Seth in the kitchen)
[00:49.46] 
[00:24.87] Let's go
[00:50.77] Brand-new Lamborghini, fuck a cop car
[01:11.04] With the pistol on my hip like I'm a cop (yeah, yeah, yeah)
[01:14.08] Have you ever met a real nigga rockstar?
[01:16.87] This ain't no guitar, bitch, this a Glock (woo)
[01:19.79] My Glock told me to promise you gon' squeeze me (woo)
[01:21.84] You better let me go the day you need me (woo)
[01:24.93] Soon as you up me on that nigga, get to bustin' (woo)
[01:27.38] And if I ain't enough, go get the chop
[01:46.38] 
[01:28.57] It's safe to say I earned it
[01:29.52] Ain't a nigga gave me nothin' (yeah, yeah, yeah)
[01:31.47] I'm ready to hop out on a nigga, get to bustin'
[01:33.92] Know you heard me say, "You play, you lay"
[01:36.86] Don't make me push the button
[01:40.20] Full of pain, dropped enough tears to fill up a fuckin' bucket
[02:11.20] 
[01:41.28] Goin' for buckets, I bought a chopper
[01:42.14] I got a big drum, it hold a 100, ain't goin' for nothin'
[01:43.56] I'm ready to air it out on all these niggas, I can see 'em runnin'
[01:45.37] Just talked to my mama
[01:47.22] She hit me on FaceTime just to check up on me and my brother
[01:48.60] I'm really the baby, she know that her youngest son
[01:49.53] Was always guaranteed to get the money (okay, let's go)
[02:17.03] 
[01:51.42] She know that her baby boy was always guaranteed to get the loot
[01:53.47] She know what I do, she know 'fore I run from a nigga
[01:55.92] I'ma pull it out and shoot (boom)
[01:56.94] PTSD, I'm always waking up in cold sweats like I got the flu
[01:59.74] My daughter a G
[02:00.73] She saw me kill a nigga in front of her before the age of two
[02:31.23] 
[02:02.20] And I'll kill another nigga too
[02:04.09] 'Fore I let another nigga do somethin' to you
[02:06.49] Long as you know that, don't let nobody tell you different
[02:09.27] Daddy love you (yeah, yeah)
[02:22.77] 
[02:11.87] Let's go
[02:13.54] Brand-new Lamborghini, fuck a cop car

[02:36.98] 'Cause the codeine had a young nigga swervin'
[02:39.37] I got the mop, watch me wash 'em like detergent
[02:41.78] And I'm ballin', that's why it's diamonds on my jersey
[02:44.57] Slide on opps' side and flip the block back, yeah, yeah
[02:46.33] My junior popped him and left him lopsided, yeah, yeah
[02:47.70] We spin his block, got the rebound, Dennis Rodman
[02:51.43] You fool me one time, you can't cross me again
[03:14.43] 
[02:53.70] 1200 horsepower, I get lost in the wind
[02:57.23] If he talkin' on the yard, the pen' dogs'll take his chin
[02:59.04] Maybach SUV for my refugees
[03:02.15] Buy blocks in the hood, put money in the streets
[03:05.24] I was solo when the opps caught me at the gas station
[03:07.81] Had it on me, 30 thousand, thought it was my last day
[03:10.06] But they ain't even want no smoke
[03:12.78] If I had to choose it, murder what she wrote
[03:34.78] 
[03:15.76] Let's go
[03:17.70] Brand-new Lamborghini, fuck a cop car
[03:19.38] With the pistol on my hip like I'm a cop (yeah, yeah, yeah)
